Hey, my name is Radek Panuszewski. I am Software Engineer and I love figuring out how things work under the hood. There is no magic in IT, really ;)

What can you expect on this blog? Mostly technical stuff around JVM, Kotlin, Gradle and IntelliJ.

Sometimes I happen to create some plugin or other utility which could be useful for others. I deeply believe in the Open Source power, so I'm going to publish everything here, as well as on my [GitHub](https://github.com/radoslaw-panuszewski).
